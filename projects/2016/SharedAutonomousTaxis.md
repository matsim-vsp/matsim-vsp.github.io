## Project description

Shared Autonomous taxi (SAT) fleets have the potential to take over a significant amount of traffic handled nowadays by conventionally driven vehicles.

Using a simulation based approach, we have been and are working on the following issues:

-   the replacement of conventional car traffic with SATs
-   the impact of SATs on traffic flow and congestion
-   the future role of public transportation systems
-   The influence of SATs on parking

## Funding agency
