## Projektbeschreibung

The goal of this project is to define a model of transit routing and its implementation with microscopic methodologies to attain a realistic description of public transport users´ behavior.  
  
In contrast to typical traffic assignment for private autos, the routing for public transport users depends on one hand on the structure and planning of the transit system, and on the other hand, on the passenger preferences to deal with that inflexible system for him or her. Due to the rigidity of transit systems elements, the passengers adapt themselves to lines paths and timetables, for example, manifesting different grade of resistance to pay high monetary costs, to walk long distances to and from stations, to wait long time for a public vehicle, to change vehicles many times, to choose detoured connections or to take slow or uncomfortable public vehicles. An agent based approach will be followed in order to assign transit connections that most suit individual priorities. However, besides the complexity of the individual selection of the most appropriate alternative, passengers consider also the effects of the imminent interaction with other public transport users especially at rush hours. With the help of transit simulation, the results of the sum of individual route choices can be indicated, so that the passengers may learn from previous decisions.  
  
State estimation methodologies will be also adopted as a way to evaluate and improve the compliance of the routing strategies with real usage of transport systems.
