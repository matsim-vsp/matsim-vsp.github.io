**FAKE TEXT - edit!**

The projects “Carrier Agents and Interactions with Traffic flows”, and “Analysis of strategies for the fully decarbonization of urban transport (ZeroCUTS)”, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), deal with the simulation of freight transport and itsthe comparison of different strategies of a transition to a full decarbonization. Therefore, MATSim is coupled with the vehicle routing problem (VRP) solver Jsprit. Solving the VPRs can be done under different conditions (e.g. vehicles, prices, technologies), resulting in different solutions to handle the demand. By comparing the results, it is possible to show the most cost-effective solution to decarbonize the freight traffic. To visualize the different scenarios, including single carriers and each tour, we use the tool SimWrapper, which was developed at our department  is used to visualize the carriers and its tours.

** Plot von Karte einfügen **

The plot visualizes the results of tour planning for a food retailing chain, transporting goods from depots to the different stores in Berlin. In several studies we show that it is possible to use battery electric trucks for these tasks instead of diesel trucks. While a few years ago their range was not sufficient for all tours, this is not an issue anymore. Moreover, the costs when using electric trucks are now comparable to using diesel trucks. 

### Interesting links to SimWrapper etc:

- vsp.berlin/simwrapper/freight-demo-1
- Other interesting things
- I'm assuming we have one page in both languages. That way just one link on the Xmas card.
