## Projektbeschreibung

The goal of this project is twofold:  
  

1.  From a methodological point of view, some methods will be applied and developed, that originate from systems engineering to the state estimation of coarse-grained systems. The project will investigate waht available state estimation methodologies are structurally eligible for traffic state estimation. This requires the formalization of traffic simulators so that applicable algorithms can be identified, modified, and new methods can be solved.
2.  The aforementioned developed methods will be applied to traffic simulations within a test bed for online telematics and offline planning traffic applications. This test bed will be integrated with our planning-oriented multi-agent traffic simulation software, MATSim, so it can be investigated, to what degree the developed online-estimation algorithms can be extended towards state estimation for planning applications in MATSim.
