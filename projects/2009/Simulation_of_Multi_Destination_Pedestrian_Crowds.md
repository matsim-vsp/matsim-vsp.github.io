## Projektbeschreibung

Rapid growth in the volume of public transport and the need for its reasonable, efficient planning has made the description and modeling of transport and pedestrian behaviors an important research topic in the last twenty years. In the study of pedestrian behaviors, so-called pedestrian dynamics, evacuation scenarios (in which pedestrians all target a definite destination) and multi-agent sys- tems (in which pedestrians are treated as heterogenous individuals, especially from a perspective of computer software) have been devoted much attention as two specific problems.  
Comparatively little attention has been paid to the problem specification of pedestrian crowd be- haviors in geometries with multiple destinations: each of the possibly many pedestrian moves to one out of a number of destinations. The objective of our project is to investigate pedestrian behaviors in such a context. The central problem arising in our project consists in the modeling of cross- ing of pedestrian streams. In view of a desirable practical relevance, realistic, i.e. rather complex geometries should be studied in this context. In the last years, several methodical approaches have been investigated for the modeling and the simulation of traffic problems. In the present context, it seems adequate to develop both microscopic approaches in which the pedestrian is considered as an individual interacting with other pedestrians, and macroscopic models in which pedestrian behavior is analyzed in terms of more global properties of a continuous stream. Our microscopic models are based on so-called coupled maps, on a grid-based ansatz rooted in cellular automata (CA) models, and on graph-based techniques. The macroscopic ansatz is based on partial differential (Euler-/Navier-Stokes-) equations (PDEs) known from fluid dynamics, in particular in the context of gas dynamics. The specific situation of multi-destination pedestrian crowds with crossing streams will require the development of appropriately adapted hybrid methods.  
Typical applications of these approaches include real-world scenarios like airports, shopping malls, buildings of middle- to large-scale etc., where the participants (i. e. the pedestrians) do not exhibit an overall unanimity and (may) have different and multiple destinations. Beyond the modeling of the above-mentioned problems, a particular aim of this project will be the development, implementation and test of appropriate computer-based simulation models. We intend to illustrate the reliability of our models by a comparison with real data to be obtained from measurements in an appropriate test environment. The models will be partly integrated into an existing software package.
