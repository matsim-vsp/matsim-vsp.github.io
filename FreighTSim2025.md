### Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

This is an announcement of the **3rd International Symposium on Multi-Agent Freight Transport Simulation (FreighTSim)**, which will take place on **16th September 2025 in Berlin, Germany**.

The 3rd FreighTSim symposium is organized jointly by:

- **German Aerospace Center**  
  *(Institute of Transport Research, Department of Transport Markets and Services)*
- **Technical University Berlin**  
  *(Chair of Transport System Planning and Transport Telematics, Chair of Commercial Transport)*

This symposium is also the **3rd Meeting of MATSim Users focusing on freight transport**.

The 3rd FreighTSim aims at sharing knowledge and expertise in microscopic and behavior-based freight transport and logistics simulation. A focus lies on **MATSim** and its freight plugins such as **jsprit** or other behavior models. We also aim at presenting the **state of practice in modelling different decision layers** (fleet composition, vehicle routing, facility location decisions) to profit the best as possible from the existing tools.

The symposium addresses representatives of different disciplines including **logistics, spatial and transport planning, and transport economics**. Practitioners, public authorities and researchers from logistics, transport and spatial planning are invited to use the symposium as a **platform for knowledge-exchange and transfer**.

If you are interested to attend the 3rd FreighTSim, you can register via e-mail.

**Experts from science and industry are also invited to give a presentation about their recent work.**  
Candidates for presentations should submit an **abstract (max. 2 pages) before 20th August 2025 by [e-mail](mailto:elija.deineko@dlr.de)**.  
Already published or submitted studies are also welcome.  
Authors will be notified by **1st September 2025** of their abstract status.


The symposium will be **free of charge**.

We look forward to see you at our symposium in Berlin!  
For further information or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact  [elija.deineko@dlr.de](mailto:elija.deineko@dlr.de)
